# Arpeggio

Notice
------

Arpeggio is stable but not currently under active development.

We've moved the repository to https://github.com/harryjubb/arpeggio for any further updates. Please open any new issues at the new location.

Outline
--------

Arpeggio calculates interatomic contacts based on the rules defined in [CREDO](http://marid.bioc.cam.ac.uk/credo). The program will be freely available and require only Open Source dependencies.

Dependencies
------------

Arpeggio is written in Python and currently has the following dependencies:

### Dependencies

- Python (v2.7)
- Numpy
- BioPython (>= v1.60)
- OpenBabel (with Python bindings)

### Recommended
- PyMOL (for visualising contacts)

Arpeggio may work with earlier versions of BioPython, however these haven't been tested. It is recommended that each dependency be the latest version.

Running
-------

`python arpeggio.py pdb [options]`

Use `python arpeggio.py -h` for available options.

Arpeggio doesn't do any checking of your PDB structure, other than what BioPython does by default. Alternate locations and missing density are not explicitly accounted for and may result in anomalous results. Please use with caution.

**Clash, Covalent, VdW Clash, VdW and Proximal interactions are mutually exclusive: Other interactions can occur simultaneously.**

Entity interactions:

- `INTER`: Between an atom from the user's selection and a non-selected atom
- `INTRA_SELECTION`: Between two atoms both in the user's selection
- `INTRA_NON_SELECTION`: Between two atoms that are both not in the user's selection
- `SELECTION_WATER`: Between an atom in the user's selection and a water molecule
- `NON_SELECTION_WATER`: Between an atom that is not in the user's selection and a water molecule
- `WATER_WATER`: Between two water molecules

### `*.bs_contacts`

As with `*.contacts`, but only including interactions in the binding site (i.e. interactions involving atoms that were selected by the user, with atoms not selected by the user, as opposed to any intra-selection interactions.

### `*.sift`

Interaction fingerprints for individual atoms. These are binary (i.e., on/off) indications of an atom's interaction, not counts.

| Column | Datatype | Description |
| ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| Atom | string `<chain_id>/<res_num><ins_code (stripped)>/<atom_name>` | Uniquely identifies the atom |
| Clash | boolean::integer | Denotes if the atom is involved in a steric clash |
| Covalent | boolean::integer | Denotes if the atom appears to be covalently bonded |
| VdW Clash | boolean::integer | Denotes if the van der Waals radius of the atom is clashing with one or more other atoms |
| VdW | boolean::integer | Denotes if the van der Waals radius of the the atom is interacting with one or more other atoms |

### `*.specific.sift`

Interaction fingerprints for individual atoms. These are binary (i.e., on/off) indications of an atom's interaction, not counts.

The columns match the `*.sift` files, but the first 15 columns (after the atom identifier) denote only interactions between the selection made by the user, and non-selection atoms; the second 15 columns indicate interactions made within the selection made by the user; and the third 15 columns indicate interactions made with water only.

### `*.siftmatch`, `*.polarmatch`

These files are for testing purposes.
